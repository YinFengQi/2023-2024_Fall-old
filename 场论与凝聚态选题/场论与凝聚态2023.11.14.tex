\section{Adding Topology Structures to XY Model}
In classical statistic mechanics, XY model is widely proposed to describe the interactions between superconductors, whose weight reads
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{Z} = \left( \prod_{\text{vertex}}^{} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \frac{\mathrm{d} \theta _{l}}{2\pi} \right) \prod_{\text{link}}^{} W \left( \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \mathrm{d} \theta_{l}} \right),
\end{equation}
where $W$ is the Boltzmann weight of the system, restricted by the $U(1)$ symmetry of $\theta$.
