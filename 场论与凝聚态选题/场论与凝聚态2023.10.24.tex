There might be a few puzzles through the derivation above, 

\subsection{General Development}
We' ve seen that a quantum field theory in $d+1$-dim spacetime can be reinterpreted as a $d$-dim space statistic field theory by regarding the time dimension as a inverse temperature, but it is not so obvious when we did not mop up the integration for conjugate momenta $\pi$. We need to find a way in whole, to figure out in what situation a field theory can be seen as a statistic field theory. \emph{``Just as the time when we heard about the formalism of Lagrangian mechanic, all cumbersome processes of force analysis disappeared.''}
