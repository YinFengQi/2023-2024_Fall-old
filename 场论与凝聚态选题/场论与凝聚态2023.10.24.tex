There might be a puzzle through the derivation above, 
\begin{quote}
    \emph{Before integrating out $\pi$, the $\exp$ term contains $\pi \mathrm{i} \partial_{\tau} \phi$. This match seems presentation-depending.
    How to figure out this mapping in a presentation independent way?}

\subsection{General Development}
We' ve seen that a quantum field theory in $d+1$-dim spacetime can be reinterpreted as a $d$-dim space statistic field theory by regarding the time dimension as a inverse temperature, but it is not so obvious when we did not mop up the integration of conjugate momenta $\pi$. We need to find a way in whole, to figure out in what situation a quantum field theory can be seen as a statistic field theory. \emph{``Just as the time when we heard about the formalism of Lagrangian mechanic, all cumbersome processes of force analysis disappeared.''}

\textbf{The answer is by locality and unitarity.}

Let us first compare the behaviors between QFT and stat. mech.

\clearpage
We have came to the conclusion that a theory with locality (of course with Hermitian Hamiltonian whilst) is always accompanied by a real and positive partition function $\mathcal{Z}$.



In the following it will be convinced that \emph{if and only if} the generative functional of a Euclidean field theory is real and positive, it has a \emph{classical stat. mech. interpretation}.

Sufficiency can be easily verified, as we have
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{Z} = \int \mathcal{D} \phi  \, \exp\left( - \beta \int \mathrm{d} ^{d+1} r' \, \mathcal{H}(\phi) \right),
\end{equation}
no imaginary part appears in the expression of $\mathcal{Z}$.
\footnote{The integration of $\mathcal{D} \phi $ can be approximated by summation on a large amount of field configurations, which turns out to be Mont Carlo method for stat. mech.}

Proof of necessity is carried out by utilizing locality, as path integral can be performed in a certain subset on spacetime.\footnote{but there's no locality in momentum space.}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/splited_base_manifold.pdf}
    \caption{Splited base manifold}
    \label{split_manifold}
\end{figure}
Splitting the base manifold into small parts, as shown in Fig\ref{split_manifold}, the path integral on each sub-manifold is fully determined by the b.c. on each $\partial\Sigma'_{i}$. Hence the path integral on $\Sigma'$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{Z}_{\Sigma'} = \int \left( \text{b.c. of all boundary} \right) \prod_{i} \mathcal{Z}_{\Sigma' _{i} \text{ (b.c.)}}.
\end{equation}
Given that locality and unitarity guarantee that all $\mathcal{Z}_{\Sigma'_{i}}$ are \emph{real and positive}, such $\mathcal{Z}_{\Sigma'_{i}}$ is undoubtedly doable to be turned into the form of $\mathrm{e}^{- \tilde{\beta} \left( \cdots \right) }$, thus there always exists an effective Hamiltonian density and corresponding inverse temperature to match this QFT with a stat.~mech. interpretation.


\section[When do Symmetries Break Spontaneously]{SSB: What is Broken? Why no Tunneling?}

A name of ambiguity was designated to refer as the physical picture behind SSB, resulting a widespread misconstruction among juvenile learners, that ``\emph{a potential with minimal value at non-zero field strength will lead to SSB as vacuum state is static and tends to minimize its Hamiltonian.}'' But such explanation will be no longer compatible if one try to replicate this in a statistic field theory and he would eventually figure out that the ensemble expectation value of field strength in ground state will remain zero.
