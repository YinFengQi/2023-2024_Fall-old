There might be a puzzle through the derivation above, 
\begin{quote}
    \emph{Before integrating out $\pi$, the $\exp$ term contains $\pi \mathrm{i} \partial_{\tau} \phi$. This match seems presentation-depending.
    How to figure out this mapping in a presentation independent way?}

\subsection{General Development}
We' ve seen that a quantum field theory in $d+1$-dim spacetime can be reinterpreted as a $d$-dim space statistic field theory by regarding the time dimension as a inverse temperature, but it is not so obvious when we did not mop up the integration of conjugate momenta $\pi$. We need to find a way in whole, to figure out in what situation a quantum field theory can be seen as a statistic field theory. \emph{``Just as the time when we heard about the formalism of Lagrangian mechanic, all cumbersome processes of force analysis disappeared.''}

\textbf{The answer is by locality and unitarity.}

Let us first compare the behaviors between QFT and stat. mech.

We have came to the conclusion that a theory with locality (of course with Hermitian Hamiltonian whilst) is always accompanied by a real and positive partition function $\mathcal{Z}$.


% might exist mistakes to be corrected

% In the following it will be convinced that \emph{if and only if} a Euclidean QFT admits \emph{Monte Carlo}, this QFT has a \emph{classical stat. mech. interpretation}.

% Sufficiency can be easily verified, as we have
% \begin{equation}
%   \mathcal{Z} = \int \mathcal{D} \phi  \, \exp\left( - \beta \int \mathrm{d} ^{d+1} r' \, \mathcal{H}(\phi) \right),
% \end{equation}
% where the integration of $\mathcal{D} \phi $ can be approximated by summation on a large amount of field configurations, which turns out to be Mont Carlo method. 

% Proof of necessity is carried out by utilizing locality

\section[When do Symmetries Break Spontaneously]{SSB: What is Broken? Why no Tunneling?}

A name of ambiguity was designated to refer as the physical picture behind SSB, resulting a widespread misconstruction among juvenile learners, that ``\emph{a potential with minimal value at non-zero field strength will lead to SSB as vacuum state is static and tends to minimize its Hamiltonian.}'' But such explanation will be no longer compatible if one try to replicate this in a statistic field theory and he would eventually figure out that the ensemble expectation value of field strength in ground state will remain zero.
