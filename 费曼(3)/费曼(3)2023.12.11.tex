\textbf{Parity isn't conserved in weak interaction.}

Symmetry leads to conservation, a eigenstate of a symmetry $Q$ which commutes with the Hamiltonian $[H, Q] = 0$ stays as the eigenstate of $Q$ and its eigenvalue is conserved.
And the expectation value of $Q$ on a state is also conserved. 


However, we cannot verify that the Hamiltonian $H$ is conserved by the steps above, for the fact that $[H,H] = 0 \implies [H, U] = 0$. The way to check whether $H$ is conserved is to figure whether $H$ contains time explicitly.
